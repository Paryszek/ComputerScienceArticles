# Hello world

Hello everyone! I started this blog as something for myself, as journey to become a better version of me, as place to store Computer science knowledge, handy algorithms and refined coding patterns in one place. I wish to make it as much accessible as possible to everyone.

My name is Michał Parysz, and I am polish Software Engineer, I specialize in Front-end technologies, I graduated from Lodz University of Technology with Master’s Degree. As hobby I create games and draw in pixel art, and also I take part in game jams.

In this blog I would like to talk about various topics oscillating around my area of interests, in other words I will talk about stuff that interest’s me, mostly from Computer science overall, Front-end technologies, Game development, Pixel art, and so on.

Developing my own website and presenting information enforces good quality content and it’s beneficial to the community and me. To write about some interesting topic and mastering it is very crucial, also avoiding peoples bad criticism can become good motivation.

I hope you will find here something useful, I can only encourage you to come by from time to time to watch my journey of self development, and share you feedback. Sometimes its good to hear out some good ideas. 

From my side I can only promise to make this blog worth a while.

Thank you!

Michał Parysz
